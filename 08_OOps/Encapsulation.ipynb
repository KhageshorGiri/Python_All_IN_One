    "# Encapsulation\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsuation is one of the fundamental concepts in object-orientd programming. Encapsulation is the concept fo bundling data and method within a single unit. It describes the idea of wrapping data and the methods that work on data within one unit. This pust restrictions on accessing variables and methods directly and can prevent the accidental modification of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "A class is an example of encapsulation as it binds all the data members and method into a single unit.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### In this example, we create an Employee class by defining employee attributes such as name and salary as an instance variable and implementing behavior using work() and show() instance methods."
